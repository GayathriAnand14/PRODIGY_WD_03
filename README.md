# Task 3- Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application 

This is **Task 3** of my web development internship at **prodigy InfoTech**

It is a simple and interactive 3x3 board game designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.The game allows two players (X and O) to take alternate turns, with the goal of aligning three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game also detects a win or draw and provides a restart button to replay.

## KEY FEATURES:

- Two-player mode (X vs O)

- Game logic to check for win or draw

- Restart button to reset the game board

- Simple and clean UI using CSS
